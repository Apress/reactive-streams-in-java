# Demo of Spring Boot + Reactor + MongoDB

Welcome to HumbleCode, my demo code for Spring Boot, Reactor, and reactive-mongo.

This code is part of the leanpub book, [Reactive Streams in Java](https://leanpub.com/reactivestreamsinjava).

The example is built around an online Course catalog and includes security, WebFlux configuration, 
and even some payment logic.
